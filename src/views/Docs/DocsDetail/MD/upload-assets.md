## Asset details

**Fractional vs single asset ownership**

- You have the ability to determine if your atomic assets can be owned only by one person or if the ownership can be fractionalized.
- For single ownership, do not check the box next to **“These assets will use fractionalized tokens”**.
- To allow fractional ownership check off the box next to **“These assets will use fractionalized tokens”**.
- In the field below determine how many fractional tokens are allowed for each of your atomic assets.

**Asset topics**

- Select topics that best describe your atomic assets. Add as many custom topics as needed. These topics assist in discoverability on the permaweb. Learn more about asset discoverability tags (ANS-110) [here](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-standards/blob/master/ans/ANS-110.md).
