## Core concepts

**Fundamental concepts of Helix and the permaweb.**

#### Atomic asset

An atomic asset is a unique digital item stored on Arweave. Unlike traditional NFTs, the asset data is uploaded together with a smart contract in a single transaction which is inseparable and does not rely on external components.

On other chains, the asset data, metadata, and smart contract are typically separate from each other with the smart contract linking to the other components. Atomic assets ensure that all data is stored together onchain to ensure permanence and accessibility.

##### Atomic asset collection

Atomic asset collections are groups of atomic assets bundled together and displayed as a collection on the UCM. These collections can consist of existing atomic assets owned by the user, newly uploaded assets, or a combination of both.

#### Ardrive Turbo

[Ardrive Turbo](https://ardrive.io/turbo-bundler/) is a payment service that bridges fiat currency to $AR and bundles data into larger, more efficient uploads to the Arweave network. Turbo credits are purchased with fiat currency through a Stripe integration on Helix.

All uploads to the permaweb via Helix is done with Turbo credits. Support for uploads with $AR are under development.

#### Universal Data License (UDL)

The Universal Data License defines the terms and conditions for using media assets on the permaweb. The UDL establishes a framework for licensing digital media such as images, videos, audio, graphics and more.

Instead of platforms setting the terms and conditions, on the permaweb creators define how their media can be utilized.

#### Universal Content Marketplace (UCM)

The Universal Content Marketplace (UCM) is a revolutionary protocol built on the permaweb, specifically designed to enable trustless exchange of atomic assets. It empowers creators and users alike to interact, trade, and transact with any form of digital content, from images and music to videos, papers, components, and even applications.
