# Listing atomic assets on the UCM

From Helix you can list your atomic asset collections on the Universal Content Marketplace (UCM).

All collections are listed in the native currency of the permaweb, $U.

**Please note that only collections can be listed directly from Helix. Single assets must be listed from BazAR.**

### Listing collections

- Select **Create listings**
- **Listing price ($U)** represents the unit price for each asset that will be listed in the UCM.
- **Listing percentage (1 - 100%)** This value represents the percentage of available content tokens to list for sale.
