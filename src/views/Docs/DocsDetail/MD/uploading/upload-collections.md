## Upload an atomic asset collection

Create an atomic asset collection from either existing atomic assets or uploading new atomic assets.

- First select the **collection** tab on the top right of the upload page.
- To upload atomic assets and edit metadata, follow the steps in the last section.
- To add existing atomic assets to the collection, choose existing assets by checking off the box next to the assets.

### Collection details

- **Title** - Title of the collection displayed on the UCM.
- **Description** - Description of the collection displayed on the UCM.
- **Fractional vs single asset ownership**
  - You have the ability to determine if your atomic assets in the collection can be owned only by one person or if the ownership can be fractionalized.
  - For single ownership, do not check the box next to **“These assets will use fractionalized tokens”**.
  - To allow fractional ownership check off the box next to **“These assets will use fractionalized tokens”**.
  - In the field below determine how many fractional tokens are allowed for each of your atomic assets.
- **Asset topics**: Select topics that best describe your atomic assets. Add as many custom topics as needed. These topics assist in discoverability on the permaweb. Learn more about asset discoverability tags (ANS-110) [here](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-standards/blob/master/ans/ANS-110.md).
  **Renderer**Render-With tags are used to specifiy a default way for an atomic asset to be rendered. Atomic assets may have metadata information which may be lost if the media is shared pre-rendered by applications built on top of Arweave. A standard way to specify a rendering application for such data allows directly sharing the Transaction ID of the raw data asset (which is atomically linked to its associated Metadata) and have it be rendered/experienced in the way it was meant to be viewed. Read more about [ANS-108: Render-With](https://specs.arweave.net/?tx=rF3z0U1rsUJyJLhKGzigoPZPuxuHn3HRT80SZdGQBd4).
- **Banner**: Upload a banner image to display at the top of the collection. (Recommended size: 16:9 aspect ratio, 1920 x 1080 pixels).
- **Thumbnail**: Upload a thumbnail image for the collection. (Recommended size: 1:1 aspect ratio, 300 x 300 pixels).
