## Welcome to Bazar Studio

Bazar Studio (FKA Helix) is your introduction to uploading atomic assets to Arweave’s permaweb.

#### Why the permaweb?

Creating on the permaweb opens the doors to instant sharing and engagement across permaweb platforms. Content is no longer siloed in centralized platforms. Your work becomes discoverable and collectible by people who appreciate and value great content. As the permaweb social sphere widens, your atomic assets will have an even broader reach.

#### Why create atomic assets?

**Atomic assets are permanent**. Your digital creations can live forever on Arweave’s permaweb. You no longer have to worry about centralized platforms controlling content that users create.

**Atomic assets are fully onchain**. Many NFT marketplaces handle transactions onchain, but the art itself often lives on centralized servers. In this case, you do not truly own the digital content. On Arweave, you will see that the full asset (content and metadata) lives fully onchain in one transaction.

**You can leave a lasting digital impact**. With atomic assets on Arweave, you are essentially creating a digital archive of content that is unique to you. Creating atomic assets allows you to archive your work in a decentralized space, ensuring its longevity and accessibility for future generations.

#### Earn on your own terms

Creating on the permaweb provides an opportunity to capture value from your creative endeavors. With the economic freedom offered by atomic assets, creators can monetize their work directly, bypassing traditional intermediaries and unlocking new revenue streams.

Creators can also set the terms for how their content can be used with the Universal Data License (UDL). Creators can upload atomic assets with UDL tags in the metadata, indicating how the media is licensed. This programmable data license gives creators full control over how their atomic assets are accessed and used.

#### Conclusion

Atomic assets on Arweave are about building a fairer and freer internet where creators own and control their content. By creating with Bazar, you're contributing to a decentralized ecosystem where creators are empowered to monetize their creativity on their own terms, free from the constraints of traditional platforms and advertisers. So, why wait? Create atomic assets and join us in shaping the future of digital ownership and expression.
