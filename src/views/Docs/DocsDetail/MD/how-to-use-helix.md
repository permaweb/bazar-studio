### How to use Helix

Helix is an easy to use tool that allows creators to upload atomic assets and create tradeable collections for your existing atomic assets. Here are the steps for how to get started uploading to the permaweb with Helix.

#### Connect your permaweb profile

When entering Helix you will be asked to connect with your Arweave wallet. You will need a permaweb profile to be able to upload through Helix. To make a permaweb profile, you must connect your Arweave wallet on [BazAR](https://bazar.arweave.dev/#/) and follow the profile creation steps.

You can create an Arweave wallet with [Arconnect](https://www.arconnect.io/) or [Othent](https://othent.io/).

#### Home tab

Once your profile is connected, you will see your account at the top, existing assets under the heading **Assets**, and your atomic asset collections under the heading **Collections**.

There is also a button to see your profile in [BazAR](https://bazar.arweave.dev/#/).

#### Upload tab

On the **Upload** tab you will now be able to upload atomic assets, enter metadata, and create atomic asset collections.

Before beginning the upload process, select the tab in the top right corner to choose between uploading a **Collection** or single **Atomic Assets**.

- **Collection** means that the atomic assets will be displayed together in a group.
- Single **Atomic Assets** means that the atomic assets will be uploaded individually.
