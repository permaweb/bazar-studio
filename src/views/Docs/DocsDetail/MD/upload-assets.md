#### Asset details

**Fractional vs single asset ownership**

- You have the ability to determine if your atomic assets can be owned only by one person or if the ownership can be fractionalized.
- For single ownership, do not check the box next to **“These assets will use fractionalized tokens”**.
- To allow fractional ownership check off the box next to **“These assets will use fractionalized tokens”**.
- In the field below determine how many fractional tokens are allowed for each of your atomic assets.

**Asset topics**

- Select topics that best describe your atomic assets. Add as many custom topics as needed. These topics assist in discoverability on the permaweb. Learn more about asset discoverability tags (ANS-110) [here](https://specs.g8way.io/#/view/SYHBhGAmBo6fgAkINNoRtumOzxNB8-JFv2tPhBuNk5c).

**Renderers**
Render-With tags are used to specifiy a default way for an atomic asset to be rendered. Atomic assets may have metadata information which may be lost if the media is shared pre-rendered by applications built on top of Arweave. A standard way to specify a rendering application for such data allows directly sharing the Transaction ID of the raw data asset (which is atomically linked to its associated Metadata) and have it be rendered/experienced in the way it was meant to be viewed.
