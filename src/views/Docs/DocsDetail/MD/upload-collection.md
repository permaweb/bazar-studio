## Upload an atomic asset collection

Create an atomic asset collection from either existing atomic assets or uploading new atomic assets.

- First select the **collection** tab on the top right of the upload page.
- To upload atomic assets and edit metadata, follow the steps in the last section.
- To add existing atomic assets to the collection, choose existing assets by checking off the box next to the assets.

### Collection details

- Title - Title of the collection displayed on the UCM.
- Description - Description of the collection displayed on the UCM.
- Fractional vs single asset ownership
  - You have the ability to determine if your atomic assets in the collection can be owned only by one person or if the ownership can be fractionalized.
  - For single ownership, do not check the box next to **“These assets will use fractionalized tokens”**.
  - To allow fractional ownership check off the box next to **“These assets will use fractionalized tokens”**.
  - In the field below determine how many fractional tokens are allowed for each of your atomic assets.
- Collection code - A collection code is a unique identifier for your collection. It can be used to identify which collection an asset belongs to in other applications. Ex: On Bazar, if your collection code is "cryptopunk," your collection assets are named "cryptopunk#1," "cryptopunk#2," etc...).
- Asset topics: Select topics that best describe your atomic assets. Add as many custom topics as needed. These topics assist in discoverability on the permaweb. Learn more about asset discoverability tags (ANS-110) [here](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-standards/blob/master/ans/ANS-110.md).
- Banner: Upload a banner image to display at the top of the collection. (Recommended size: 16:9 aspect ratio, 1920 x 1080 pixels).
- Thumbnail: Upload a thumbnail image for the collection. (Recommended size: 1:1 aspect ratio, 300 x 300 pixels).
