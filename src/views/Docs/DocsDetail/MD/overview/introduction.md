#### How to use Bazar Studio

#### Connect your permaweb profile

When entering Bazar you will be asked to connect with your Arweave wallet. You will need a permaweb profile to be able to upload. To make a permaweb profile, you must connect your Arweave wallet on [Bazar](https://bazar.arweave.net/#/) and follow the profile creation steps.

You can create an Arweave wallet with [Arconnect](https://www.arconnect.io/) or [Othent](https://othent.io/).

#### Home tab

Once your profile is connected, you will see your account at the top, existing assets under the heading **Assets**, and your atomic asset collections under the heading **Collections**.

There is also a button to see your profile in [Bazar](https://bazar.arweave.net/#/).

#### Upload tab

On the **Upload** tab you will now be able to upload atomic assets, enter metadata, and create atomic asset collections.

Before beginning the upload process, select the tab in the top right corner to choose between uploading a **Collection** or single **Atomic Assets**.

- **Collection** means that the atomic assets will be displayed together in a group.
- Single **Atomic Assets** means that the atomic assets will be uploaded individually.

## Create atomic assets

Creating atomic assets isn't just about creating digital content; it's about empowering creators to take control of their creative works and create economic value on their own terms. By bringing your content fully onchain, with real-world rights, you're not just showcasing your creativity; you're creating a new internet economy that is owned by the creators and forever preserved on the Arweave network.

#### Why create atomic assets?

**Atomic assets are permanent**. Your digital creations can live forever on Arweave’s permaweb. You no longer have to worry about centralized platforms controlling content that users create.

**Atomic assets are fully onchain**. Many NFT marketplaces handle transactions onchain, but the art itself often lives on centralized servers. In this case, you do not truly own the digital content. On Arweave, you will see that the full asset (content and metadata) lives fully onchain in one transaction.

**You can leave a lasting digital impact**. With atomic assets on Arweave, you are essentially creating a digital archive of content that is unique to you. Creating atomic assets allows you to archive your work in a decentralized space, ensuring its longevity and accessibility for future generations.

#### Why the permaweb?

Creating on the permaweb opens the doors to instant sharing and engagement across permaweb platforms. Content is no longer siloed in centralized platforms. Your work becomes discoverable and collectible by people who appreciate and value great content. As the permaweb social sphere widens, your atomic assets will have an even broader reach.

#### Earn on your own terms

Creating on the permaweb provides an opportunity to capture value from your creative endeavors. With the economic freedom offered by atomic assets, creators can monetize their work directly, bypassing traditional intermediaries and unlocking new revenue streams.

Creators can also set the terms for how their content can be used with the Universal Data License (UDL). Creators can upload atomic assets with UDL tags in the metadata, indicating how the media is licensed. This programmable data license gives creators full control over how their atomic assets are accessed and used.

#### Conclusion

Atomic assets on Arweave are about building a fairer and freer internet where creators own and control their content. By creating with Bazar, you're contributing to a decentralized ecosystem where creators are empowered to monetize their creativity on their own terms, free from the constraints of traditional platforms and advertisers. So, why wait? Create atomic assets and join us in shaping the future of digital ownership and expression.
